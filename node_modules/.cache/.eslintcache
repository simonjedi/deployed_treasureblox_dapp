beginning of time the universe as we know it has been transforming and a new multi dimensional bridge is starting to form  linking humanity to the meta verse. This bridge is a magical place where gaming meets reality.\n              <br/><br/>\n              Princess Veronica has commanded her kingdom in the meta verse speed up construction of the bridge using TreasureBlox, to give the people of planet Earth access to her kingdoms technology, so they can make their planet more exciting and solve their problems.\n              <br/><br/>\n              This has attracted many treasure explorers from planet Earth, mainly from a place called Italy, to find blox and help bridge the gap between the Metaverse and reality. News is spreading fast so princess Veronica has decided to accelerate the development of her new DAPP portal to show and help the people of earth interact with the metaverse.\n              <br/><br/>\n              As the bridge is being built, an escaped villain 'Crypto Dave' threatens to destroy the bridge and keep all the treasure blox for himself. He will do this by showing the people of Earth that the Metaverse is bad. His first attempt was to steal the richest man on Earths rocket blueprint.

If you participate in games you'll be awarded points for certain actions such as playing games or unlocking levels.\n              <br/><br/>\n              This is then used to calculate a return for you when the main prize pot for the game is won! The prize pot constantly increases in size.\n              <br/><br/>\n              Prize pots for treasure hunts are divided in various ways. The most common way is that the winner will be awarded 30% of the total treasure fund when the final clue is solved.\n              <br/><br/>\n              Explorers who entered are then awarded a proportion of the remaining 70% of the prize pot as a percentage of how many points they have. All normal transfer fee's apply at the point of distribution of the tokens. This means prize pots grow excluding transaction fees whilst playing.\n              <br/><br/>\n              Prize funds may also be seeded with funds from the main treasure fund holding of Blox. This means that effectivly explorers who enter gain by earning increased blox at the point of distribution.\n              <br/><br/>\n              Our unique model also acts as a token stabiliser. We like to call it a treasure vault as all tokens locked in the vault can't be used until the final clue is solved, removing them from circulation and stabalising our token value.\n              <br/><br/>\n              Because we have multiple games this means even if one fund is won, others act to stabalise holders token value. Holders will also benefit as the token is deflationary and blox are used for all game interactions. Thus creating a natural upwards buy pressure for holders.</p>\n              <br/><br/>\n\n                <Link to=\"/hunt1\">\n                  <Button className=\"customButtonBlog\" onClick={play_elons_quest} to=\"/hunt1\">Play Elon's Quest</Button>\n                </Link>\n\n              </Card.Body>\n            </Card>\n\n\n            </Col>\n            <Col sm={4}>\n            <br/>\n\n\n            <Card className='cardRounded'>\n              <Card.Img variant=\"top\" src={img3} alt=\"Logo\" className='customRounded'/>\n              <Card.Body >\n                <Card.Title className=\"gameTitle\">The Story So Far</Card.Title>\n                <div>Crypto Dave has broken into fort blox and stolen the treasure.

This locks BLOX until the prize is won! We also provide liquidity rewards with our official partner CafeSwap where you can earn BLOX and Brew for staking or farming.\n              <br/><br/>\n\n              We have also integrated treasure vaults as part of our games, all tokens locked in the vault can't be used until the final clue is solved. This removes the tokens from circulation stabilising our token value.\n              <br/><br/>\n              Because we have multiple games this means even if one fund is won others act to stabilise holders token value. Holders will also benefit as the token is deflationary and BLOX are used for all game interactions. Thus creating a natural upwards buy preasure for holders.\n              <br/><br/>\n\n              Token holders will also be pleased to know that TreasureBlox partnered with CafeSwap, a BSC yield farming and staking platform.\n              <br/><br/>\n              CafeSwap will be offering a farm where users stake BLOX-BNB to earn BREW, with the option to re-invest BREW to earn more BLOX, and a pool where users stake BREW to earn BLOX. The farm and pool launched at 1100 UTC on Friday 3rd of September. This partnership results in the following:\n              <br/><br/>\n              - Increased liquidity for TreasureBlox<br/>\n              - - Rewards for BLOX holders who stake on CafeSwap, earning BREW<br/>\n              - Rewards for BREW holders who enter the pool and earn BLOX<br/>\n              - - Increase TreasureBlox's profile through exposure to CafeSwap's community<br/>\n              <br/><br/>\n              As TreasureBlox's first partnership, it is an exciting step in the projects development, with many such partnerships in the pipeline. Click the link below to check out CafeSwap and enter the pool/farm.\n              <br/><br/>\n\n\n              <br/><br/>\n              Liquidity was prioritised post-launch to increase resilience of the BLOX token - the CafeSwap farm and pool does just that, and will help TreasureBlox, and the BLOX token, grow and develop over time. The partnership has been funded through the development wallet.\n              <br/><br/>\n              The TreasureBlox team would also like you to know that community feedback and engagement is critical to us.

TreasureBlox has also identified a strategic opportunity to provide Treasure Hunts As A Service (THAAS) to other projects within the DeFi space. Read on to learn more about these exciting developments!\n              <br/><br/>\n              TreasureBlox P2E platform\n              <br/><br/>\n               By launching a P2E games platform, TreasureBlox is enabling BLOX-holding explorers to compete against each other and earn BLOX on the latest DeFi gaming platform. By playing mini games, explorers are awarded points for playing games and winning which solves clues for the Treasure Pot; scores are tracked through the all new TreasureBlox Leaderboard, which determines reward distribution when the treasure hunt is solved. Explorers will now be competing against each other to move up the\n              <br/><br/>\n               Leaderboard and earn a bigger reward!\n              <br/><br/>\n               As more explorers join the hunt, the Treasure Pot grows in size, and, once the treasure hunt is solved, the reward is distributed across all participants. The explorer who solves the final clue is awarded 30% of the Treasure Pot, while the remaining 70% is distributed to all participants determined as a percentage share of the explorer’s points. By having proportional rewards, explorers are incentivised to participate in, compete with other explorers and solve the treasure hunt, as all explorers gain when the hunt is over.\n               <br/><br/>\n              Storyline – Help Captain Troy ‘Mighty’ Armstrong save the Metaverse!\n              <br/><br/>\n               An all-new storyline with characters and voice-overs has been written for the treasure hunts, with Princess Veronica of the Metaverse tasking Captain Troy ‘Mighty’ Armstrong with defending the bridge between the Metaverse and Planet Earth. From whom, you ask? The evil mastermind Crypto Dave! Crypto Dave is plotting to sabotage the bridge and steal all the BLOX, but Captain Troy ‘Mighty’ Armstrong is determined to stop him, with the help of explorers from Planet Earth…\n              <br/><br/>\n              Treasure Hunts As A Service\n              <br/><br/>\n               TreasureBlox has identified and is pursuing an opportunity to provide THAAS services to other crypto projects in the DeFi space.
